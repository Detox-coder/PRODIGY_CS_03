Welcome to the Advanced Password Complexity Checker!
This tool will analyze your password's security strength.

Enter password to analyze (or 'quit' to exit): [HIDDEN INPUT]

🔍 Analyzing password...

============================================================
🔒 Password Strength: Strong
📊 Security Score: 11/15
🧮 Entropy: 52.44 bits

📋 ANALYSIS BREAKDOWN:
────────────────────────────────────────
Length: ✅ Good (12-15 characters)
Uppercase: ✅ Present
Lowercase: ✅ Present
Numbers: ✅ Present
Special chars: ✅ Present

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   • Great password! Consider using a password manager
   • Increase length to 16+ characters for maximum security
============================================================
```

### Programming Interface

```python
from password_checker import AdvancedPasswordChecker

# Initialize the checker
checker = AdvancedPasswordChecker()

# Analyze a password
criteria = checker.analyze_password("MySecureP@ssw0rd!")

print(f"Strength: {criteria.strength.value}")
print(f"Score: {criteria.total_score}/15")
print(f"Entropy: {criteria.entropy} bits")

# Get detailed feedback
feedback = checker.generate_feedback(criteria)
print(feedback)
```

## 🔬 Algorithm & Mathematical Foundation

### Entropy Calculation
Password entropy measures the unpredictability using information theory:

**Formula:** `Entropy = Length × log₂(Character_Space)`

```python
Character Space Calculation:
├── Lowercase (a-z): +26 characters
├── Uppercase (A-Z): +26 characters  
├── Digits (0-9): +10 characters
└── Special chars: +32 characters (approx.)

Example: "P@ssw0rd!" = 9 × log₂(94) ≈ 59.5 bits
```

### Pattern Detection Algorithms
- **Repetition Detection:** `(.)\1{2,}` - Finds 3+ repeated characters
- **Sequential Patterns:** `(123|abc|qwer)` - Keyboard and alphabet sequences
- **Dictionary Matching:** Common password database comparison
- **Keyboard Patterns:** `(qwerty|asdf|zxcv)` - Physical keyboard layouts

---

## 🛡️ Security Analysis & Educational Value

### 🔍 **Vulnerability Assessment**

| Pattern Type | Risk Level | Detection Method | Mitigation |
|--------------|------------|------------------|------------|
| **Repeated Characters** | High | Regex pattern matching | Diverse character usage |
| **Sequential Patterns** | High | Alphabet/numeric sequences | Random character selection |
| **Keyboard Patterns** | Medium | QWERTY layout detection | Avoid adjacent keys |
| **Dictionary Words** | High | Common password database | Use passphrases instead |
| **Low Entropy** | Critical | Mathematical calculation | Increase complexity |

### 📚 **Educational Insights**
- Understanding information theory in cybersecurity
- Learning pattern recognition in security analysis
- Appreciating mathematical foundations of password strength
- Recognizing common vulnerability patterns

### 🎯 **Best Practices Enforced**
- Minimum 8-character length requirements
- Mixed character type usage (upper, lower, digits, symbols)
- Avoidance of predictable patterns
- High entropy threshold recommendations
